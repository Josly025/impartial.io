## Description \*\*\*

Trending Times is an application that allows users
to stay updated on current events via the latest
New York Times articles. An image and short description
allow a user to get the gist of an article before deciding
whether or not to view the whole article through the link
button.

Blockers: It is important to describe the problems
I had with several news API's during this project.
The original goal of this project with to illustrate news from
mulitple sources to make a non-bias form of media. In fact,
the original name for this site was called "Impartial".
The API's I used required large amounts of monthly payment
for a deployed app; therefore, I had to improvise and use the
NY Times free API.

Note: If You know of a better, free, API with great data please
email me at grantjoslyn@gmail.com. I was really hoping to have
this app pull data from multiple sources.
